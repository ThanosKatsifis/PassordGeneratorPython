# 🔐 Vault-Gen: The Thanos-Shield

**Because "password123" is basically inviting hackers to dinner.**

Built by **Thanos Katsifis**, this isn't just a random string generator. It’s a multi-layered security suite that generates, encrypts, and decrypts secrets using a custom mathematical "time-key" logic.

## 🛡️ The Superpowers

* **Three Levels of Chaos:** Choose your fighter:
* **Weak:** Easy-to-read lowercase letters.
* **Normal:** A mix of upper and lower case.
* **Strong:** The "Final Boss"—letters, numbers, and symbols combined.


* **Custom Lengths:** Pick your length from the dropdown to fit any requirement.
* **The "Thanos Cipher":** A built-in encryption engine that uses the **current date** to generate a unique mathematical key. Lock your password behind a cipher, and unlock it only when you need it.
* **One-Click Copy:** Don't waste time highlighting; hit the "Copy" button and go.

## 🧪 The Science (How it Works)

This app uses a dynamic encryption key calculated as:



Every time you encrypt, the program shifts your characters through the `digits` universe based on this daily-changing key. It’s simple, it’s clever, and it’s built right into the UI.
